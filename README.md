# HydraFunctions
A.K.A. HF, a rapid FaaS deployment system for non experts.
[Basic library standard](https://www.msfsoftware.com/art%C3%ADculos/basic-library-standard)

## Intentions
This is created to cover a specific usage case. Where you have servers available under your control. But somehow you need to deploy applications on those servers that only you are going to use.

## System requirements
* Any kind of Debian based system with PHP 8.0+
* 512MB RAM

## TODO Requirements
- [ ] HF COULD be installed in a raspberry pi.
- [ ] HF MUST be able to be operated by people that don't understand server architecture or more than basic server commands.
- [ ] This system MUST be able to deploy into a new server with composer.
- [ ] Operating system WIDE.
- [ ] HF
